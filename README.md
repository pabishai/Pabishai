### Hi there 👋 I am Abishai Omari

I am a senior fullstack software engineer (Python/Django, Angular, ReactNative, AWS) with Devops, continuous integration and deployment experience including performance monitoring and alerting.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on React Native app that supports demand-based resupply procedures and connects local (Kenya) community health workers to their resupply facility (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cstock)

### Background
I started off in tech support after graduating. I didnt like the fact that I didnt really understand the applications I was providing support for (I wont fix your computer) so I decided to do something about that and the only way was to learn how to build software to know how it works. 

I had learnt a bit of software development in my undergrad but didnt really practice it so I had to refresh myself by doing. I made an app for the place I was working for at the time that provided a report submission portal for the reports they needed from different counties in Kenya and provided a central repository that made it easier to search for a report and get information that you needed from any report.

Fast forward to today and its been a long journey from mainly JSF and content management systems to now mainly doing projects in **Javascript** and **Python** with proper CI/CD pipelines, secure servers for deployment and hosting and even add some docker containers if it makes sense.
